Q1. 
Pick 3 of the 10 categories. For each, pick a language that gives it to you for free and say what that language pays for it. "Python has dictionaries" isn't an answer. What does Python's dictionary cost in memory or in speed compared to what you built, and where would you notice?

Q2. 
You wrote the tag check in `dt_value_as_int` by hand. Some languages don't let you. They make the tagged union a language construct, so the compiler writes the check for you, refuses to compile a read that skips it, and refuses to compile a set of cases that misses one. Rust's `enum` and `match` work this way, and so do ML's datatypes and Swift's enumerations with associated values. What does the C version let you do that a compiler enforcing the check wouldn't, and is any of it worth wanting?

Q3. 
Your `dt_map` keeps insertion order separately from the hash buckets, which is memory spent on something no lookup uses. Argue the other side: describe a design that drops it, say what breaks, and say whether you'd ship it.

Q4. 
Compare access after release with an allocation that remains unreleased at the driver's final check. What damage can each cause in a long-running server? How does that answer change for a command-line tool that exits in a second?
